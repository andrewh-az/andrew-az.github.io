# Professional Portfolio with AI 


## Overview

This repository contains HTML code for a professional portfolio assignment. Per assignment instructions, the website was to be developed using AI prompting only and cross-validation across LLM models. This was an exploratory activity to understand the effectiveness of AI tools.

This was homework for my MIS 509, Strategic Communication: Engaging Stakeholders through Storytelling course at the University of Arizona.
